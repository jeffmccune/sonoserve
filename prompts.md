I'll help you initialize your project. Let me first understand what type of project you'd like to set up.

I see you have a project directory with README.md and DEVELOPER.md files. Let me check what's in these files to understand the current state of your project.

Now I understand your project - it's a server system that allows a 5-year-old to control a Sonos Play:1 speaker using an M5Stack CardPuter ESP32S3 device. The architecture involves a Go backend server and the CardPuter as a simple hotkey controller.

What specific initialization would you like me to help with? I can help you set up:

1. **Go server** - Initialize a Go module and basic server structure
2. **ESP32 firmware** - Set up the CardPuter firmware project
3. **Both** - Initialize both components

Which would you prefer?

I'll help you initialize the Go server for your Sonos control system. Let me create the basic structure for a Go project.

Go server initialized successfully! Created:

- **go.mod** - Module definition
- **main.go** - HTTP server with:
  - Health endpoint at `/health`
  - Sonos control endpoints:
    - `/sonos/play` (POST)
    - `/sonos/pause` (POST) 
    - `/sonos/restart-playlist` (POST)

Run with `go run main.go` - server listens on port 8080.

Committed successfully with message describing the Go server initialization.

## Turn 4

> Remember to add each prompt I give you to the prompts.md file.  Place my prompt as a quoted markdown string, then place your response to my prompt under the quoted prompt.  Use an h2 heading for each prompt turn.

I'll create a prompts.md file to track our conversation.

Updated prompts.md with our conversation history. I'll continue adding each new prompt and response going forward.

## Turn 5

> Commit the changes.

## Turn 6

> Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.

I'll analyze the codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file with the essential information for future Claude instances.

Created CLAUDE.md with:
- Project overview explaining the architecture
- Development commands for Go server and ESP32
- Architecture details and API endpoints
- Development workflow requirements
- Current implementation state
