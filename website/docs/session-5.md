# Session 5 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Add curl examples to controller.md

> Update the controller.md page to include example curl commands for each of the API endpoints.

I added a new "API Examples" section to the controller.md page with curl command examples for all endpoints:
- Health check
- Get speakers (list cached)  
- Discover speakers
- Play, Pause, Restart playlist
- Play preset (0-9)
- Get queue

The examples show proper HTTP methods, headers, and JSON payloads where required.

## Turn 2 - Add new control endpoints

> Please add the following endpoints. For each one take care to update the controller.md with a button to invoke the endpoint and an example curl command.
> 
> 1. Play/Pause that plays or pauses like the button on the device itself.
> 2. Next Track endpoint. (Next item in the existing queue)
> 3. Previous Track endpoint. (Prev item in the existing queue)
> 4. Volume up endpoint to increase volume 5% each call.
> 5. Volume down endpoint to decrease volume 5% each call.
> 6. Mute endpoint that mutes or unmutes the speaker each call.
> 7. Update prompts and commit.
> 
> For each endpoint, allow the speaker to be omitted from the call like the existing endpoints do. Use the default if not provided by the client. Before moving to the next task, check the server compiles using Bash(make build) then reload the server.

I successfully added all 6 new endpoints to the server:
- `/sonos/play-pause` - Toggle play/pause state
- `/sonos/next` - Skip to next track in queue
- `/sonos/previous` - Go to previous track in queue  
- `/sonos/volume-up` - Increase volume by 5%
- `/sonos/volume-down` - Decrease volume by 5%
- `/sonos/mute` - Toggle mute state

For each endpoint:
- Added handler function in main.go
- Registered route in setupRoutes()
- Supports optional speaker parameter (uses default if omitted)
- Updated controller.md with buttons and curl examples
- Server compiled successfully and was reloaded

## Turn 3 - Create ST7789V2 character code reference

> I have an M5Stamp CardPuter v1.1 with a 1.14" IPS-LCD ST7789V2. Find the data sheet that lists the valid characters I can print to the screen from the esp32s3. Once you've found the sheet produce a character code table in the website/docs/reference/character-codes.md file with links to the source data sheet. Remember to update prompts and commit.

I researched the ST7789V2 display controller and created a comprehensive character code reference document at `website/docs/reference/character-codes.md`. 

Key findings:
- ST7789V2 is a display controller that renders pixels, not a character generator
- Supports standard ASCII printable characters (32-126) through software libraries
- Character rendering depends on font libraries like Adafruit GFX or TFT_eSPI
- Can support extended ASCII, GB2312 (Chinese), and UTF-8 with appropriate fonts
- Created a complete ASCII character table with decimal, hexadecimal, and character representations
- Included implementation notes for ESP32 and example code
- Added references to relevant documentation and libraries

## Turn 4 - Add power management features to CardPuter

> We need to turn the screen off to save battery life. Modify the cardputer/controller.ino file to add the following behaviors:
> 
> 1. Turn the screen off after 30 seconds of inactivity. Refresh the screen if any key is pressed.
> 2. Display the battery life as the last line in the update display.
> 
> Note this file is an Arduino IDE 2.3.6 file for an esp32s3 device.

I successfully modified the CardPuter controller to add power management features:

**Screen Timeout (30 seconds):**
- Added variables to track screen state and last activity time
- Screen dims to brightness 0 after 30 seconds of inactivity
- Any keypress restores brightness and refreshes display
- First keypress after timeout only wakes screen (doesn't trigger actions)

**Battery Display:**
- Added `displayBatteryInfo()` function to show battery level on bottom line
- Color-coded display: Green (greater than 50%), Yellow (20-50%), Red (less than 20%)
- Shows charging status when connected to power
- Integrated into the main ready screen display

**Activity Tracking:**
- Reset activity timer on all user interactions
- Timer resets in main loop, preset requests, and control requests
- Ensures screen stays on during active use

## Turn 5 - Fix battery display issues

> Thanks, but set the text size to 2 for the battery level, and don't bother putting it at the bottom of the screen, just display it last. Also remove or fix the charging indicator, it's always on even when the USB cable is disconnected. Remember to update prompts and commit.

I fixed the battery display issues:

**Text Size and Positioning:**
- Set battery display text size to 2 (same as other text)
- Removed bottom screen positioning logic
- Battery info now displays last in natural flow after other menu items

**Charging Indicator:**
- Removed the charging indicator completely since `M5Cardputer.Power.isCharging()` was incorrectly reporting charging status
- Now shows just "Battery: XX%" without charging status

The battery display is now cleaner and consistent with the rest of the interface.

## Turn 6 - Add GET method support to preset handler

> Modify the presetHandler in main.go to handle the http GET verb.  1. Preserve the MethodPost behavior, move it to a dedicated function.  2. Add the new behavior for MethodGet which returns the playlist items as a JSON object.  3. Ensure both the POST method and the GET method call the same function to get the list of URLs to play for that preset.  4. Add a test case for the GET method for preset five that validates the playlist items are returned in sorted order.

I successfully modified the `presetHandler` in `main.go` to handle both GET and POST HTTP methods:

1. **Extracted POST behavior** into a dedicated `playPreset` function
2. **Added GET method support** that returns playlist items as JSON with fields: preset, playlist_count, and playlist_items (each item has index, title, filename, and url)
3. **Created a shared function** `getPresetPlaylistItems` that both GET and POST methods use to retrieve the sorted list of URLs
4. **Added a test case** `TestPresetHandlerGET` that validates the GET method returns playlist items in sorted order for preset 5

The GET endpoint returns a JSON response like:
```json
{
  "preset": "5",
  "playlist_count": 11,
  "playlist_items": [
    {
      "index": "0",
      "title": "03-Tuputupu (The Feast)",
      "filename": "03-Tuputupu (The Feast).mp3",
      "url": "http://192.168.2.252:8080/music/presets/5/03-Tuputupu%20%28The%20Feast%29.mp3"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Turn 7 - Clean up test file

> Remove all tests except TestPresetHandlerGET

I removed all other test functions from `main_test.go`, keeping only the `TestPresetHandlerGET` test. This simplified the test suite to focus on the core functionality we implemented. The remaining test validates:
- GET method returns 200 status
- Response has correct Content-Type (application/json)
- JSON structure includes preset, playlist_count, and playlist_items
- Playlist items are returned in sorted alphabetical order
- Each item has required fields: index, title, filename, url

## Turn 8 - End session

> Execute the tasks described in session-end.md

I executed the session-end process:
1. Renamed `website/docs/prompts.md` to `website/docs/session-5.md`
2. Created new `website/docs/prompts.md` for Session 6
3. Added template content to the new prompts.md file
4. Updated session-5.md with this final turn
5. Committed all changes with message "End Session 5 and prepare Session 6"
