# Notes

Session one started to get a bit off the rails around turn 30.  Claude kept losing the thread trying to make changes when it wasn't in an effective edit, run, test, kill, repeat loop.

I decided to start a new session instead of continue the old one.  The new session 2 starts off trying to figure out how to get the play endpoint to queue and play the mp3 file embedded into the go server.  The error returned from the speaker indicates the mime time is wrong.
