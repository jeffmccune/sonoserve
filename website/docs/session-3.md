# Session 3 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Load memory

> Load memory

Memory loaded. The project is Sonoserve - a server that allows controlling a Sonos speaker using an M5Stack CardPuter ESP32S3 device. Current state: Basic Go HTTP server with stub endpoints implemented, Web UI for testing, no ESP32 work started yet.

## Turn 2 - Add note about apostrophe issue

> Add a note to the notes file that my speaker named Kid's Room uses a different character for the apostrophe and claude munges it incorrectly which causes the play endpoint to not find the speaker in the cache. Don't fix this, I'm going to manually rename the speaker in the Sonos app to avoid this issue.

Added note about the apostrophe character issue in the speaker name.

## Turn 3 - Test play endpoint after speaker rename

> I've renamed the speaker, rebuild the server and test the play endpoint. If you get a 500 error from the play endpoint then read the stderr log file and pinpoint where the error occured.

Server rebuilt successfully. The play endpoint now returns "Invalid JSON request" instead of a 500 error. The stderr log shows speaker discovery is working - it found "Kids Room" (renamed without the special apostrophe). The endpoint expects JSON in the request body.

## Turn 4 - Test play on Kids Room and troubleshoot

> Try to play on "Kids Room" and troubleshoot if it fails by reading the sonoserve.stderr.log and coming up with a plan. Write the plan to ./website/docs/play-issue.md with an h1 of "Plan to fix Play endpoint"

Play endpoint tested on "Kids Room" - failed with error 714 "Failed to set queue URI". Created troubleshooting plan in ./website/docs/play-issue.md identifying the likely cause as incorrect MIME type for the MP3 file.

## Turn 5 - Add queue endpoint and update troubleshooting plan

> 1. Add an endpoint to get the current queue from a speaker so we can debug what's currently loaded into the speaker. Take the speaker name as a parameter. 2. Test the endpoint using curl and write the results into the plan to fix play endpoint file 3. Update the plan to include specific line numbers in main.go where the failure point happens. 4. Remember to update prompts and commit.

Added /sonos/queue endpoint to get current queue contents from a speaker. The queue endpoint confirmed that tracks are being added to the queue successfully, but the failure occurs at line 385 in main.go when calling `s.SetAVTransportURI(0, "Q:0", "")`. Updated play-issue.md with test results and specific line numbers showing the exact failure point.

## Turn 6 - Update dev-loop.sh for build error handling

> Update the dev-loop.sh script to write "error: please stop and wait for human" to the server.status file if the build fails. Remember to update prompts and commit.

Updated dev-loop.sh to handle build failures gracefully. Removed `set -e` flag and added error handling around `make build` command. If build fails, the script now writes "error: please stop and wait for human" to server.status and waits for rebuild command instead of exiting.

## Turn 7 - Update playHandler metadata field

> Update the playHandler to set the EnqueuedURIMetaData field to the filename of the songURL. Update prompts and commit.

Updated playHandler in main.go to extract filename from songURL and set it in the EnqueuedURIMetaData field. The metadata now uses DIDL-Lite XML format with the filename (without extension) as the dc:title. This should provide proper track metadata to the Sonos device when adding tracks to the queue.

## Turn 8 - Enhance queue endpoint with detailed debugging info

> Update the que endpoint to return the uri of the enqueued item in addition to the medata. I want to see the details of the queue for debugging. Test the queue endpoint. Update prompts and commit.

Updated the queue endpoint to extract and return detailed information about each queue item including index, id, title, uri, creator, album, track_number, class, album_art_uri, parent_id, and restricted status. Tested the endpoint and confirmed it now shows the track URI (http://192.168.4.134:8080/music/sample.mp3) and metadata (title: "sample.mp3") properly. The enhanced response provides much better debugging visibility into the queue contents.

## Turn 9 - Comprehensive troubleshooting and root cause analysis

> Read the play-issue.md file, think hard about it (the line numbers are no longer accurate). 1. Run through the troubleshooting steps. 2. Update the whole document with a new plan to fix the issue. 4. Include detailed output. 5. Update prompts and commit.

Ran through all troubleshooting steps and discovered the real root cause. The MP3 file serves correctly with proper Content-Type: audio/mpeg, and tracks are successfully added to the queue. The actual issue is incorrect usage of SetAVTransportURI(0, "Q:0", "") - "Q:0" is an object ID, not a playable URI. The solution requires: 1) Adding SVC_CONTENT_DIRECTORY service to get queue metadata, 2) Using GetMetadata(ObjectID_Queue_AVT_Instance_0) to get the proper playable URI. Completely rewrote play-issue.md with detailed troubleshooting output, corrected root cause analysis, and specific implementation plan.

## Turn 10 - Implement fixes and successfully resolve play endpoint issue

> Read the play-issue.md file. 2. Implement the proposed fixes. 3. Test the play endpoint. 4. Think hard about the results and update the play-issue.md file if the play endpoint fails. 5. Repeat the process until the play endpoint is fixed. 6. Update prompts and commit. Context: if after 3 tries the issue is not fixed, search the internet to identify a simpler way to play an mp3 using an http url.

SUCCESS! Implemented both proposed fixes: 1) Updated service configuration to include SVC_CONTENT_DIRECTORY (line 314), 2) Replaced SetAVTransportURI call with GetMetadata approach (line 389). Test results: Play endpoint now returns "Playing playlist on Kids Room" and stderr log shows "Queue URI set successfully, starting playback..." and "Successfully started playback on Kids Room". The error 714 is completely resolved and music is now playing on the Sonos speaker. Updated play-issue.md with successful implementation results.

## Turn 11 - End session 3

> Great thanks. The play endpoint works. Let's end the session. 1. Move the prompts.md to session-3.md in the same directory. 2. Create a blank promots.md for Session 3 3. Update prompts (in session-3.md) 4. Commit everything.

Session 3 completed successfully! The main accomplishment was fixing the play endpoint error 714. Moved prompts.md to session-3.md, created new blank prompts.md for Session 4, and committed all changes. The Sonos integration is now fully functional with working play endpoint that successfully starts music playback on the speaker.
