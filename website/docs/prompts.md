# Session 3 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Load memory

> Load memory

Memory loaded. The project is Sonoserve - a server that allows controlling a Sonos speaker using an M5Stack CardPuter ESP32S3 device. Current state: Basic Go HTTP server with stub endpoints implemented, Web UI for testing, no ESP32 work started yet.

## Turn 2 - Add note about apostrophe issue

> Add a note to the notes file that my speaker named Kid's Room uses a different character for the apostrophe and claude munges it incorrectly which causes the play endpoint to not find the speaker in the cache. Don't fix this, I'm going to manually rename the speaker in the Sonos app to avoid this issue.

Added note about the apostrophe character issue in the speaker name.

## Turn 3 - Test play endpoint after speaker rename

> I've renamed the speaker, rebuild the server and test the play endpoint. If you get a 500 error from the play endpoint then read the stderr log file and pinpoint where the error occured.

Server rebuilt successfully. The play endpoint now returns "Invalid JSON request" instead of a 500 error. The stderr log shows speaker discovery is working - it found "Kids Room" (renamed without the special apostrophe). The endpoint expects JSON in the request body.

## Turn 4 - Test play on Kids Room and troubleshoot

> Try to play on "Kids Room" and troubleshoot if it fails by reading the sonoserve.stderr.log and coming up with a plan. Write the plan to ./website/docs/play-issue.md with an h1 of "Plan to fix Play endpoint"

Play endpoint tested on "Kids Room" - failed with error 714 "Failed to set queue URI". Created troubleshooting plan in ./website/docs/play-issue.md identifying the likely cause as incorrect MIME type for the MP3 file.
