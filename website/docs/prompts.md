# Session 6 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Verify test sorting matches filesystem

> I've updated the comment of the expectedFiles variable in the TestPresetHandlerGET function. Think about the comment and update the test accordingly. Update prompts and commit.

I examined the updated comment which clarifies that files should be sorted using numeric sort (`sort -n`). After checking:

1. Listed files in preset 5 using `ls -1 *.mp3 | sort -n`
2. Compared the API response with the actual embedded filesystem
3. Verified that both lexicographic sort (current implementation) and numeric sort produce the same order

The test is already correct because:
- The embedded filesystem contains 11 files (not all 16 from the actual filesystem)
- All files have two-digit numeric prefixes, so lexicographic and numeric sorting produce identical results
- The expectedFiles array already matches the actual API response in the correct order

No changes to the test were needed as it already reflects the correct numeric sorting order.
