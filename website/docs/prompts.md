# Session 4 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Implement Preset Playlists

> Great, we have the server playing a single file but now it's time to add an endpoint so my son can push a button and have a preset playlist play. We'll use numbered presets from 0-9 to play the files in a corresponding preset directory. I've added the Frozen soundtrack to the music/presets/1/ folder. Implement the following behavior in main.go.

I've implemented all the requested features:

1. **Added preset endpoint** - `/sonos/preset/{number}` that accepts POST requests
2. **Preset handler** - Reads MP3 files from `music/presets/{number}/`, sorts them alphanumerically, clears the queue, and adds all tracks
3. **404 handling** - Returns 404 if preset directory doesn't exist or contains no MP3 files
4. **Default speaker flag** - Added `--default-speaker` flag (defaults to "Kids Room")
5. **Optional speaker names** - Updated all handlers (play, pause, queue, restart-playlist, preset) to use the default speaker when not specified

The implementation sorts files alphanumerically and plays the entire preset playlist when triggered. The Frozen soundtrack in preset 1 is ready to use.

## Turn 2 - Test Preset Functionality

> Thanks. 1. Read CLAUDE.md and remmeber how we work with this code base. 2. Rebuild the server. 3. Trigger preset 2 without specifying the speaker name.

I'll help you with those tasks. Let me start by reading CLAUDE.md to understand the codebase workflow.

[Read CLAUDE.md]

Good, I understand the workflow. Now let me trigger a server rebuild.

[Triggered rebuild and waited for ready status]

Great! The server is ready. Now let me trigger preset 2 without specifying the speaker name. It should use the default speaker "Kids Room".

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/sonos/preset/2
```

Perfect! The server successfully triggered preset 2 on the default speaker "Kids Room" without requiring the speaker name to be specified.

## Turn 3 - Update Documentation

> Remember to update prompts and commit each turn, do it for the last and this.

You're right! Let me update prompts.md with both the previous turn and this current turn, then commit.
