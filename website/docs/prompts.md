# Session 4 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Implement Preset Playlists

> Great, we have the server playing a single file but now it's time to add an endpoint so my son can push a button and have a preset playlist play. We'll use numbered presets from 0-9 to play the files in a corresponding preset directory. I've added the Frozen soundtrack to the music/presets/1/ folder. Implement the following behavior in main.go.

I've implemented all the requested features:

1. **Added preset endpoint** - `/sonos/preset/{number}` that accepts POST requests
2. **Preset handler** - Reads MP3 files from `music/presets/{number}/`, sorts them alphanumerically, clears the queue, and adds all tracks
3. **404 handling** - Returns 404 if preset directory doesn't exist or contains no MP3 files
4. **Default speaker flag** - Added `--default-speaker` flag (defaults to "Kids Room")
5. **Optional speaker names** - Updated all handlers (play, pause, queue, restart-playlist, preset) to use the default speaker when not specified

The implementation sorts files alphanumerically and plays the entire preset playlist when triggered. The Frozen soundtrack in preset 1 is ready to use.
