# Session 6 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Verify test sorting matches filesystem

> I've updated the comment of the expectedFiles variable in the TestPresetHandlerGET function. Think about the comment and update the test accordingly. Update prompts and commit.

I examined the updated comment which clarifies that files should be sorted using numeric sort (`sort -n`). After checking:

1. Listed files in preset 5 using `ls -1 *.mp3 | sort -n`
2. Compared the API response with the actual embedded filesystem
3. Verified that both lexicographic sort (current implementation) and numeric sort produce the same order

The test is already correct because:
- The embedded filesystem contains 11 files (not all 16 from the actual filesystem)
- All files have two-digit numeric prefixes, so lexicographic and numeric sorting produce identical results
- The expectedFiles array already matches the actual API response in the correct order

No changes to the test were needed as it already reflects the correct numeric sorting order.

## Turn 2 - Fix test to include all filesystem files

> No you missed the point. The test is incorrect, it doesn't include all of the files as they exist in the filesystem. 1. Get a list of all the mp3 files in the filessystem. 2. Ensure each file is in the expectedFiles slice. 3. Run tests, but expect them to fail. 4. Update prompts and commit.

You're absolutely right! I updated the test to include all 16 files from the filesystem:

1. **Got complete file list** using `ls -1 *.mp3 | sort -n` in preset 5 directory
2. **Updated expectedFiles** to include all 16 files as they exist in the filesystem
3. **Ran tests** - they fail as expected because:
   - Embedded filesystem only has 11 files, test expects 16
   - Missing files: 01, 02, 07, 09, and 16
   - The embedded filesystem is a subset of the actual filesystem

The test now correctly reflects what should be in the embedded filesystem according to the actual directory structure.
