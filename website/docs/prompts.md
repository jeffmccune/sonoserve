# Session 5 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Add curl examples to controller.md

> Update the controller.md page to include example curl commands for each of the API endpoints.

I added a new "API Examples" section to the controller.md page with curl command examples for all endpoints:
- Health check
- Get speakers (list cached)  
- Discover speakers
- Play, Pause, Restart playlist
- Play preset (0-9)
- Get queue

The examples show proper HTTP methods, headers, and JSON payloads where required.
