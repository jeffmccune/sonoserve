# Session 3 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Load memory

> Load memory

Memory loaded. The project is Sonoserve - a server that allows controlling a Sonos speaker using an M5Stack CardPuter ESP32S3 device. Current state: Basic Go HTTP server with stub endpoints implemented, Web UI for testing, no ESP32 work started yet.

## Turn 2 - Add note about apostrophe issue

> Add a note to the notes file that my speaker named Kid's Room uses a different character for the apostrophe and claude munges it incorrectly which causes the play endpoint to not find the speaker in the cache. Don't fix this, I'm going to manually rename the speaker in the Sonos app to avoid this issue.

Added note about the apostrophe character issue in the speaker name.
