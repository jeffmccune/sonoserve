# Session 2 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Create dev-loop.sh script

> Create a dev-loop.sh script in the root of the repo that uses the make build task to build the project, then execute the binary in the background capturing stderr to a log file you can read. Wait for the ready endpoint to return true read a line from a fifo. If the line says "rebuild" repeat the loop, clearing out the log files.

Created `dev-loop.sh` that:
- Builds using `make build`
- Runs the binary with stderr redirected to `sonoserve.stderr.log`
- Waits for the health endpoint to return successfully
- Reads from FIFO `/tmp/sonoserve-dev-loop.fifo`
- Rebuilds when "rebuild" is sent to the FIFO

Usage: `./dev-loop.sh` then `echo rebuild > /tmp/sonoserve-dev-loop.fifo` to trigger rebuilds.

## Turn 2 - Reminder to update prompts.md

> Remember to update prompts.md and commit each iteration.

Updating prompts.md with the latest conversation and committing changes.

## Turn 3 - Fix dev-loop.sh executable path

> Thanks but the dev-loop.sh script calls the wrong executable, it should be ./bin/sonoserve

Fixed dev-loop.sh to use the correct executable path `./bin/sonoserve`.

## Turn 4 - Add server.status file writing

> Update the dev-loop.sh script to write a server.status file to the root of the repo for you to read. When the rebuild command is recieved, write over this file content with "rebuilding". When the server is ready, write "ready" to this file.

Updated dev-loop.sh to write status to server.status file:
- Writes "rebuilding" when starting build or receiving rebuild command
- Writes "ready" when server health check passes

## Turn 5 - Modify health endpoint to wait for initial discovery

> Modify the ready endpoint to wait for initial discovery to complete.

Modified the health endpoint to:
- Return 503 Service Unavailable with message "Initial discovery in progress" until discovery completes
- Return 200 OK once initial discovery is complete
- Added global flag `initialDiscoveryComplete` to track discovery status
- Set flag to true after startup discovery finishes

## Turn 6 - Create dev-rebuild.sh script

> Add a dev-rebuild.sh script that executes echo rebuild > /tmp/sonoserve-dev-loop.fifo so you can execute this script without prompting me.

Created `dev-rebuild.sh` script that triggers a rebuild by sending "rebuild" to the FIFO.
