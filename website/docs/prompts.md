# Session 5 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Add curl examples to controller.md

> Update the controller.md page to include example curl commands for each of the API endpoints.

I added a new "API Examples" section to the controller.md page with curl command examples for all endpoints:
- Health check
- Get speakers (list cached)  
- Discover speakers
- Play, Pause, Restart playlist
- Play preset (0-9)
- Get queue

The examples show proper HTTP methods, headers, and JSON payloads where required.

## Turn 2 - Add new control endpoints

> Please add the following endpoints. For each one take care to update the controller.md with a button to invoke the endpoint and an example curl command.
> 
> 1. Play/Pause that plays or pauses like the button on the device itself.
> 2. Next Track endpoint. (Next item in the existing queue)
> 3. Previous Track endpoint. (Prev item in the existing queue)
> 4. Volume up endpoint to increase volume 5% each call.
> 5. Volume down endpoint to decrease volume 5% each call.
> 6. Mute endpoint that mutes or unmutes the speaker each call.
> 7. Update prompts and commit.
> 
> For each endpoint, allow the speaker to be omitted from the call like the existing endpoints do. Use the default if not provided by the client. Before moving to the next task, check the server compiles using Bash(make build) then reload the server.

I successfully added all 6 new endpoints to the server:
- `/sonos/play-pause` - Toggle play/pause state
- `/sonos/next` - Skip to next track in queue
- `/sonos/previous` - Go to previous track in queue  
- `/sonos/volume-up` - Increase volume by 5%
- `/sonos/volume-down` - Decrease volume by 5%
- `/sonos/mute` - Toggle mute state

For each endpoint:
- Added handler function in main.go
- Registered route in setupRoutes()
- Supports optional speaker parameter (uses default if omitted)
- Updated controller.md with buttons and curl examples
- Server compiled successfully and was reloaded
