# Session 3 - Prompts and Responses

## Turn 1 - Load memory

> Load memory

Memory loaded. The project is Sonoserve - a server that allows controlling a Sonos speaker using an M5Stack CardPuter ESP32S3 device. Current state: Basic Go HTTP server with stub endpoints implemented, Web UI for testing, no ESP32 work started yet.

## Turn 2 - Add note about apostrophe issue

> Add a note to the notes file that my speaker named Kid's Room uses a different character for the apostrophe and claude munges it incorrectly which causes the play endpoint to not find the speaker in the cache. Don't fix this, I'm going to manually rename the speaker in the Sonos app to avoid this issue.

Added note about the apostrophe character issue in the speaker name.

## Turn 3 - Test play endpoint after speaker rename

> I've renamed the speaker, rebuild the server and test the play endpoint. If you get a 500 error from the play endpoint then read the stderr log file and pinpoint where the error occured.

Server rebuilt successfully. The play endpoint now returns "Invalid JSON request" instead of a 500 error. The stderr log shows speaker discovery is working - it found "Kids Room" (renamed without the special apostrophe). The endpoint expects JSON in the request body.

## Turn 4 - Test play on Kids Room and troubleshoot

> Try to play on "Kids Room" and troubleshoot if it fails by reading the sonoserve.stderr.log and coming up with a plan. Write the plan to ./website/docs/play-issue.md with an h1 of "Plan to fix Play endpoint"

Play endpoint tested on "Kids Room" - failed with error 714 "Failed to set queue URI". Created troubleshooting plan in ./website/docs/play-issue.md identifying the likely cause as incorrect MIME type for the MP3 file.

## Turn 5 - Add queue endpoint and update troubleshooting plan

> 1. Add an endpoint to get the current queue from a speaker so we can debug what's currently loaded into the speaker. Take the speaker name as a parameter. 2. Test the endpoint using curl and write the results into the plan to fix play endpoint file 3. Update the plan to include specific line numbers in main.go where the failure point happens. 4. Remember to update prompts and commit.

Added /sonos/queue endpoint to get current queue contents from a speaker. The queue endpoint confirmed that tracks are being added to the queue successfully, but the failure occurs at line 385 in main.go when calling `s.SetAVTransportURI(0, "Q:0", "")`. Updated play-issue.md with test results and specific line numbers showing the exact failure point.

## Turn 6 - Update dev-loop.sh for build error handling

> Update the dev-loop.sh script to write "error: please stop and wait for human" to the server.status file if the build fails. Remember to update prompts and commit.

Updated dev-loop.sh to handle build failures gracefully. Removed `set -e` flag and added error handling around `make build` command. If build fails, the script now writes "error: please stop and wait for human" to server.status and waits for rebuild command instead of exiting.
